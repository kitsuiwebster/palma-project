## Data Sources

### Primary Dataset
- **PalmTraits 1.0**: The foundational dataset containing morphological and ecological data for palm species worldwide.

### Enrichment Sources
1. **GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)**
   - Over 1.8 million palm observations
   - Provides occurrence data and taxonomic information

2. **iNaturalist**
   - Over 250,000 palm observations
   - Citizen science platform with photo documentation

3. **POWO (Plants of the World Online)**
   - Definitive source for accepted taxonomy
   - Maintained by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew

4. **Wikimedia Commons**
   - Repository of CC-licensed palm images
   - Used for visual documentation of species

---

## Methodology

The dataset was developed through the following process:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Primary data extracted from PalmTraits 1.0
   - Enriched with API queries to GBIF, iNaturalist, and POWO

2. **Taxonomic Harmonization**
   - Reference taxonomy from POWO used as standard
   - Resolution of synonymies and taxonomic inconsistencies

3. **Validation and Cleaning**
   - Rigorous validation to identify and correct outliers
   - Manual verification of inconsistent records using scientific literature

4. **Geospatial Enrichment**
   - Addition of environmental information from global geospatial layers
   - Characterization of ecological niches

5. **Analysis and Visualization**
   - Statistical methods applied to explore patterns
   - Visualization of distribution and trait relationships
